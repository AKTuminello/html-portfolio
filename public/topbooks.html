<h1>The Best Books of All Time--According to Ann</h1>
<hr />
<h2>The Top Three:</h2>
<br />
<h3>The Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling.</h3>
<p>Yes, I know those are more than one book, but I refuse to break them up.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Anne of Green Gables Series by L.M. Montgomery.</h3>
<p>Ha. Gotcha again. One simply does not choose one book of a great series.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Mercy Thompson Series by Patricia Briggs.</h3>
<p>As of this writing, there are 13 of them, each better than the last.</p>
